# Gold-Refinement-Project-ML-

In this project, we have been tasked with creating a model which can predict the percentage of gold recovery from a gold-refinement process, given all kinds of gold-ore parameters as features. The target value is defined within the project.

We are supplied with two pre-defined datasets - one for training the model, and one for testing it. We will need to perform some EDA in order to detect problems in the data, such as outliers, and take care of them accordingly. Once this is done, we will set out to find the model which gives the best metric results. The metric in this study is a custom one, definition and calculation of which is given within the project.

In this project, we have used the following libraries/modules:
<ul>
  <li>pandas</li>
  <li>numpy</li>
  <li>matplotlib</li>
  <li>seaborn</li>
   <li>various modules from sklearn</li>
</ul>
